    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Sushi is a Japanese dish of prepared vinegared rice (鮨飯, sushi-meshi), 
        usually with some sugar and salt, accompanied by a variety of ingredients 
        (ねた, neta), such as seafood, often raw, and vegetables. </p>

    <p>Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be 
        prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with 
        seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat.</p>


    <h4>Ingredients</h4>

    <h5>For the rice</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>300g sushi rice</li>
        <li>100ml rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tbsp golden caster sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>For the Japanese mayonnaise</h5>

    <ul>
        <li>3 tbsp mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1 tbsp rice wine vinegar</li>
        <li>1 tsp soy sauce</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h5>For the sushi</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>25g bag nori (seaweed) sheets</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><b>Pat out some rice.</b> Lay a nori sheet on the mat, shiny-side down. Dip your hands in the vinegared water, then pat handfuls of rice on top in a 1cm thick layer, leaving the furthest edge from you clear.</li>
        <li><b>Spread over some Japanese mayonnaise.</b> Use a spoon to spread out a thin layer of mayonnaise down the middle of the rice.</li>
        <li><b>Add the filling.</b> Get your child to top the mayonnaise with a line of their favorite fillings - here we've used tuna and cucumber.</li>
        <li><b>Roll it up.</b> Lift the edge of the mat over the rice, applying a little pressure to keep everything in a tight roll.</li>
        <li><b>Stick down the sides like a stamp.</b> When you get to the edge without any rice, brush with a little water and continue to roll into a tight roll.</li>
        <li><b>Wrap in cling film.</b> Remove the mat and roll tightly in cling film before a grown-up cuts the sushi into thick slices, then unravel the cling film.</li>
        <li><b>Layer over some smoked salmon.</b> Line a loaf tin with cling film, then place a thin layer of smoked salmon inside on top of the cling film.</li>
        <li><b>Cover with rice and press down.</b> Press about 3cm of rice over the fish, fold the cling film over and press down as much as you can, using another tin if you have one.</li>
        <li><b>Tip it out like a sandcastle.</b> Turn block of sushi onto a chopping board. Get a grown-up to cut into fingers, then remove the cling film.</li>
        <li><b>Good appetit !</b></li>
    </ol>
